## Task

* Make a test account API
* Use the customer journey dataset **customer_journeys_sample.json** as source for your training and test sets
* Train a new conversion type
* Create a jupyter notebook where you use the webservice for test evaluation
* Make an analysis - in the jupyter notebook - with charts on what perspectives you find interesting
* Add some discussion with 2-3 detailed ideas and example on what questions and focus areas you would approach next in this context


## Deliverable

- a Jupyter Notebook that answers the questions above
- please explain your approaches and state any assumptions that you make and that are not mentioned in the challenge
- if you use charts/pivots to answer the questions, please include them as well in your report
- keep your results concise, no need to mention findings unrelated to the questions above


## Note: We don't expect you to build THE perfect analysis and report here.
Our goal here is:
* See how you approach such a problem
