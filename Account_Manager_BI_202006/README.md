# Account Manager E-comm Business Intelligence Challenge
With this challenge we want to test your ability to calculate interesting KPIs, interpret them
and to derive usable insights from them.

## Task
Obviously, we want you to analyze the data in the csv file. ;-)

But we also want you to visualize your findings and calculations in order to get "useful" insights 
out of it.

Here are some KPIs which might be interesting:
- CPC
- ROI
- CPA 
- CPRO: cost per re-order
- CVR: conversion rate

Note: The data is provided on **event dates**, when the session happend, 
so you only see a parts of the customer journeys which is happend in the selected period.


## Columns in the CSV file

- Event_Date: date when the session happend	
- Channel: name of the traffic channel	
- Campaign: name of the traffic campaign	
- Browser_type: device type	
- Engagement_Phase: respective user interaction label (new or return)	
- Users: number users 
- Sessions: number sessions	
- Costs: amount of cousts, from known cost sources	
- Influenced_Conversions: number of conversions which are influenced or affected, similar to GA's assisted conversions	
- Attributed_Initializer_Conversions: attributed initializer-phase conversions	
- Attributed_Holder_Conversions: attributed holder-phase conversions	
- Attributed_Closer_Conversions: attributed closer-phase conversions	
- Attributed_IHC_Conversions: attributed joined IHC conversions (1/3 weight on each phase)
- Attributed_IHC_Revenue: attributed IHC revenue


## Deliverable

- a clean and self explaining Excel workbook with all calculations
- if possible some insightful (!) charts and pivots with brief explanations 
- PDF (max 3-4 pages!) with brief explanation of steps taken and the summary of results, as you would give it to a client.
 

## Note: We don't expect you to build THE perfect analysis and report here.
Our goal here is:
* See how you approach such a problem
* Get an idea of your skills
